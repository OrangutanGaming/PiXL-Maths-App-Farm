# PiXL-Maths-App-Farm

This project requires atleast Python 3.6 (can probably use 3.4). It may not work correctly on MacOS or Linux

## Setup
1. `pip install -U -r requirements.txt` or `pip3 install -U -r requirements.txt`
2. Edit the coordinate values (this may be improved with point values that will work with any resolution monitor as long as you use Firefox and have a bookmark toolbar as this is the setup I used. The existing coordinates are for 1440x900)
3. Install Tesseract
4. Change the paths for Tesseract and the temp screenshot save location
5. Run `app.py`
